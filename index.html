                Located at the foothills of the Himalayas, Haridwar is a city of temples and ashrams and its pious
                ambience envelops everyone. Haridwar is one of the four holy Indian cities that host the Kumbh Mela, a
                pious gathering of millions of Hindu devotees every 12 years. The Ardh Kumbh is organised here every six
                years.

                hosted the annual International Yoga Festival on the first week of March since 1999. Rishikesh is a
                vegetarian-only and alcohol-free city. The Tehri Dam is located 86 km (53 mi) away from Rishikesh.
